                        To provide our students with a comprehensive and rigorous education that forms the bedrock for critical thinking and analytical skills across various disciplines, our high school has established the Institute of Arts and Sciences. This expansion includes the introduction of additional undergraduate and graduate programs, including the Bachelor of Science in Business Administration, Bachelor of Science in Entrepreneurship, Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering, Bachelor of Science in Fine Arts, and Master of Public Administration. These initiatives have led to a consistent growth in student enrollment, reflecting our commitment to offering diverse educational opportunities and meeting the evolving needs of our student body.

                        "Because of the collaborative efforts of dedicated officials, faculty members, staff, and friends of CBHSN, many lives continued to be transformed through academic excellence, innovation, research and development, and leadership. Former Congressman Aurelio D. Gonzales, Jr. of the Third District of Pampanga as well as municipal and provincial leaders extended full support in the pursuit of the conversion of the College into a state university after two similar attempts failed in the past. A thorough evaluation of the collegeâ€™s performance over the years was conducted by the technical working groups of the Commission on Higher Education, the Senate Commission on Education, Culture, and Arts, and the House Commission on Higher Technical Education. Finally, CBHSN was found ready to be bestowed a university status."
